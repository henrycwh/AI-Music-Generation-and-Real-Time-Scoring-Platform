# AI Music Generation and Real-Time Scoring Platform

## Overview

The **AI Music Generation and Real-Time Scoring Platform** is an innovative music creation system that utilizes deep learning techniques to generate and evaluate music quality in real-time. This project integrates **Transformer-WGAN** for music generation and employs a **discriminator network** for objective evaluation of generated music. It also features an **interactive neural network training interface** that enables developers to adjust model parameters and monitor training logs in real-time.

By leveraging AI-powered music generation and real-time scoring, this platform aims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and music composition, providing a seamless experience for researchers, musicians, and AI enthusiasts.

## System Architecture

The AI music generation system is structured as follows:

1. **User requests music generation** - The system generates a MIDI sequence using the **Transformer-WGAN** model.
2. **Real-time music evaluation** - The **discriminator network** assesses the generated music quality.
3. **Web-based interaction** - Users can adjust model parameters and view results on a **real-time dashboard**.
4. **OBS streaming** - The system supports **OBS Studio** integration for live performance broadcasting.
